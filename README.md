EXOS
====

Experimental exokernel based operating system.  Currently in an non-usable state, as there are an incredible number of OS functions that must be programmed before work on LibOS' can even begin.

Currently Working Towards:
- CPU scheduler
- Filesystem Drivers
- Basic shell (long ways off)
